# LCSC Custom Cable Order Guide (OpenArm Example)

This document describes how we ordered custom cables for the OpenArm project using LCSC's custom cable service.

LCSC allows you to upload a simple connection diagram (PDF or PNG) instead of using their menu-based configurator, enabling more flexible orders.

## Ordering Procedure

### 1. Prepare a Drawing

Create a diagram (PDF or PNG) that includes:

- Connector types (e.g., JST PH-2P female/male)
- Cable length (e.g., 300 mm)
- Pin assignments (e.g., GND, VCC)
- Quantity (e.g., 10 pieces)
- Any additional notes (e.g., heat shrink, sleeve)

### 2. Upload and Place Order

1. Visit https://lcsc.com/custom-cable.html  
2. Upload your diagram in the “Upload Detailed Drawing” section  
3. Enter quantity and other details, then click "Order"

---

### 3. Quotation and Payment

- About 1 business day later, a quotation will appear in the order management screen  
- If the price is acceptable, proceed with payment (e.g., via PayPal)

---

### 4. Confirm Manufacturing Drawing

- About 1 more business day later, you will receive a formal manufacturing drawing (PDF)  
- **Please check the following carefully**:
  - Connector part numbers
  - Pin layout
  - Cable length, color, sleeve, etc.

- If everything is correct, click “Confirm”

---

### 5. Manufacturing and Shipping

- After confirmation, manufacturing begins  
- Production typically takes 5–10 business days  
- The package will arrive in Japan within a few more days

## Tips and Cautions

- Specify exact part numbers (e.g., JST SXH-001T-P0.6) if possible  
- Hand-drawn diagrams are acceptable, but make them clear and unambiguous  
- Start with a small order to verify  
- Use simple English – Google Translate is often sufficient
